# VBA-challenge

This code loops through the stock data and calculates several values for each worksheet in the workbook.

First it populates a ticker symbol in the summary table for each distinct stock ticker symbol. Then it calculates the yearly change from the first open to the final close for that stock in the year. Next it finds the percent change and total volume for each ticker.

Last it creates an additional summary table for each worksheet and calculates the stock with the greatest percent increase, the stock with greatest percent decrease, and the stock with the greatest total volume.
